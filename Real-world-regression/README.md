This folder contrains scripts for analyzing meta-in-context learning from LLMs on [multi-dimensional real-world regression datasets](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v58/lichtenberg17a.html)

# Running scripts:
## 1. query_icl.py
This script evaluate and stores the in-context learning (icl) performance of LLMs on the datasets.

## 2. query_mil.py
This script evaluate and stores the meta-in-context learning (mil) performance of LLMs on the datasets.

## 3. baseline_runs.py
This script evaluate and stores the performance of baseline models on the datasets, e.g: Random Forest, SVM, Bayesian Linear Regression, etc.

# Plotting scripts:
## plot_acrosstrials.py
This script plots the performance of LLMs and baseline models on the datasets (Figure 4.A in the paper).

## plot_extreme_preds.py
This script plots the percentage of extreme predictions of LLMs on the datasets (Figure 4.B in the paper).

## plot_similarities.py
This script plots a regression onto MSE's Beta coefficients (Figure 4.C in the paper). The regressors are:
1. The similarity between the test tasks and meta-in-context learning tasks.
2. The trials

## Directory Structure:
data_srm/: Contains the original datasets in .rdata format.

data/: Contains generated data stored in CSV files.

plots/: Contains plots generated by the plotting scripts.
